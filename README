FindMassAssignment
==================

The find_mass_assignment Rake task finds likely mass assignment problems.

The method is to scan the controllers for likely mass assignment, and then find the corresponding models that *don't* have attr_accessible defined.  Any time that happens, it's a potential problem.


Example
=======

Suppose line 17 of the Users controller is

  @user = User.new(params[:user])

but the User model *doesn't* define attr_accessible.  Then we get the output

$ rake find_mass_assignment

/path/to/app/controllers/users_controller.rb
  17  @user = User.new(:params[:user])

This indicates that the User model has a likely mass assignment vulnerability.
